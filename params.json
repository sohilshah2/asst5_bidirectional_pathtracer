{"name":"Assignment 5: Bidirectional Pathtracer","tagline":"","body":"# Assignment 5 Project Idea Proposal\r\n#### Author: Sohil Shah (sohils)\r\nFor this project, I would like to implement a bidirectional path tracing algorithm by extending the assignment 3 code. The main goal of this would be to render correct images with lower variance according to the same wall clock time. This should also help greatly with effects such as cuastics due to the faster convergence of the integral. \r\n## Plan\r\n## Ideal Result","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
